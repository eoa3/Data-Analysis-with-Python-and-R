# Data Analysis Using Python and R    
# Aim 

The aim of these projects was to make predictions using various machine learning algorithms and choose from the analysis the best model that gave the least error.

### Supervised Machine Learning was deployed using the Regression Method
## Steps taken in making an informed decision on the project are as follows:
1. Data Pre-processing.
2. Data Visualization.
3. Missing value Analysis.
4. Outlier Analysis.
5. Feature Selection.
 -  Correlation analysis.
6. Feature Scaling.
 -  Normalization.
7. Splitting into Train and Test Dataset.
8. Hyperparameter Optimization.
9. Model Development
I. Linear Regression 
II. Support Vector Regression 
III. ARIMA  
IV. Random Forest 
10. Model Performance.
